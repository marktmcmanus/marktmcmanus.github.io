My name is Mark McManus and I have been programming for near 30 years. I've worked on a wide range of products/project including Visual Programming languages, Web Site builders,User Interface class libraries, Remote Patient Monitoring and most recently mission management software for my current employer, CarteNav Solutions. Within those projects I done quite a few task, but the one that I have enjoyed the most, and like to think became pretty good at is UI/UX programming. Most recently that has been for desktop applications written in C++. Notice I said above UI/UX programming and not UI/UX design, I am not a designer. Currently I am very luck to work with a very talented designer whose work I like to think I bring to life. 

I intend for this blog to be a place for me to write about some the challenges and I encountered and the solutions I have come up with, hopefully there is something in here that can help someone else.
